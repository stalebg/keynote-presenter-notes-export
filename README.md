An AppleScript that extracts the presenter notes from an open Keynote presentation and save them to a text file on the Desktop. It also copies the presenter notes to the clipboard.

## üìã Prerequisites

You must have a Keynote presentation open on your Mac.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Open the Script Editor on your Mac. You can do this by pressing `Command + Space` to open Spotlight, then typing "Script Editor" and hitting `Return`.

2. Create a new script by clicking on "File" in the top menu and then "New" (or press `Command + N`).

3. Copy the script content from `Keynote_presenter_notes_export.scpt` and paste it into the new script window in the Script Editor.

4. Save the script by clicking on "File" in the top menu and then "Save" (or press `Command + S`). Give your script a name, and make sure the file format is set to "Script."

5. With the Keynote presentation that you want to extract presenter notes from open and in the foreground, go back to the Script Editor.

6. Run the script by clicking on the "Script" icon in the top menu and then "Run" (or press `Command + R`).

7. The script will create a text file on your Desktop containing the presenter notes from your Keynote presentation. The name of the text file will be "keynote-notes-" followed by the name of your presentation. The presenter notes will also be copied to your clipboard.

A checkmark or a computer emoji could work well with the compatibility section. Here's how it could look:

## üíª Compatibility

The script has been confirmed to work on an M1 Mac running macOS Ventura version 13.3.1 and Keynote version 13.0.
